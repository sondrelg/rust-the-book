Functions
-
- Rust code uses snake case
- Input parameters/arguments *must* declare the type of each parameter.
- Return statements for rust functions are unnecessary as long as the line does not contain a semi-colon
     ```rust
     fn multiply_by_five(x: i32) -> i32 {
        5 * x
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let x = multiply_by_five(5);
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
    ```
   with a semi-colon, `return` needs to be specified
   ```rust
   fn multiply_by_five(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return 5 * x;
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let x = multiply_by_five(5);
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
  ```
