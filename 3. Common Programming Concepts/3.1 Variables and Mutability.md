Variables and Mutability
- 
- Variables are mutable

- Defining a variable twice as in:
    ```rust
    let x = 15
    let x = x + 5
    ```
    is called shadowing.
    
    - Shadowing is preferred to mutating a variable in some cases, as the variable remains immutable after the transformation. 
    - Shadowing allows you to change variable types, unlike when changing a mutable variable.
